	This project implements a virtual registry, where students can check their grades(and only their grades) and an Admin that has maximum privilege and can add student or modify their grades.

	In order to use this tool as close as possible to how it would be used in reality, you should follow these steps:
		-Use the log in function and type in the credentials for the Admin account(username: Admin01 and password: Admin01pa55) - super secure :)
		-Add students to the registry, and optionally give them some grades(max 4, in accordance to the rules of the school)
		-Exit from the Admin account
		-Select create account and enter the required data
		-Make as many accounts as you want
		-Test these accounts by logging in, using the credentials you previously set and displaying the grades.
