<h1>Virtual Registry<h1>
<p>
This project's goal was to make a working virtual registry and implementing as many OOP concepts.
<br>
Therefore, the registry has an administrator account, from which the students and their grades are added and permits students to make accounts and check their grades(and only their grades).
</p>
<p>
In order to use this tool as close as possible to how it would be used in reality, you should follow these steps:
<ul>
	<li>
		Use the log in function and type in the credentials for the Admin account(username: Admin01 and password: Admin01pa55) - super secure :)
	</li>
	<li>
		Add students to the registry, and optionally give them some grades(max 4, in accordance to the rules of the school)
	</li>
	<li>
		Exit from the Admin account
	</li>
	<li>
		Select create account and enter the required data
	</li>
	<li>
		Make as many accounts as you want
	</li>
	<li>
		Test these accounts by logging in, using the credentials you previously set and displaying the grades.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
